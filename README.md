lem-ipc is a project in the 42 advanced. It is about learning inter process communication.

you can compile the project by using the Makefile at the root of the repo wich will make both binaries
One for the "player" of the project and one for the visualizer wich can be used to summon players.

In the visualizer you can press S to summon a player and scroll to change wich team you are spawning in.
You can also click to place/break walls that block players.

The visualizer uses the minilibx from 42.
